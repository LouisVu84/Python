Teemu Leisti,351716,27140701,54,"@Jörg W Mittag: I disagree. ""Class"" and ""processor speed"" (to pick an example) are two completely different concepts, but ""class"" and ""type"" are closely related concepts. For instance, here's what [the Wikipedia article on Class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_programming%29) says: ""In object-oriented programming, a class is a construct that is used to define a distinct type."" tadman was being helpful to the questioner."

Teemu Leisti,351716,27144621,12,"@Jörg W Mittag: I continue to assert that ""class"" and ""type"" are certainly not completely different concepts in OO, as demonstrated by the quote. (Also: how do you declare a variable in Java? By giving *either* the *type* or the *class* of the variable, followed by its name: ""`int i`"" or ""`Integer j`"".) tadman answered the question in a way that seemed to satisfy both the questioner and the general audience, while clarifying the terminology Ruby uses. I have no interest in getting into academic hair-splitting over the finer points of object-oriented terminology, so please have the last word."

msvalkon,300791,26569414,4,"My assumption is that it's a buffering issue. Everything you write to a file is written through a buffer and will not end up in the file until that buffer is determined to be full (not entirely true, but you can think of it this way). You should really use the `with`-statement when dealing with files, which handles the `file.close`-call automatically."
Nakedible,146423,26568843,4,"Oh, it's likely deterministic. It's exactly the same thing as when the C standard leaves something to be implementation defined behavior. The reason it is like this is that different implementors can pick different implementation choices."

Esailija,995876,26652259,4,"@fusio yes, you can do something like `inherits(Mouse, Animal);` that cleans up the inheritance set up a bit. The difference is that you are creating new function identity for each instantiated object instead of sharing one function. If you have 10 mice, you have created 10 function identities (that is only because mouse has one method, if it had 10 methods, 10 mice would create 100 function identities, your server would quickly waste most of its CPU on GC :P), even though you will not use them for anything. The language doesn't have enough expressive power to optimize this away currently."

Teemu Leisti,351716,26464082,3,"@Bryan: To venture a guess, you might want to do this in a banking application, when converting a currency amount that the user has input, in order to deal with only integers inside the application: for instance, converting dollars and cents to cents.

He can email the registration key to himself and use that in his computer. I just toyed around with my application a bit and it seems that calling `register` always returns a different key while the documents say otherwise. It also seems that when sending a GCM message to the server, the GCM server responds with the new registration key of the device, just one which you have to save. If you don't save it and use that in future requests, the GCM messages won't go through."

Esailija,995876,26655600,0,"@AwakeZoldiek in my experience in most questions the problem has been `this` binding with event handlers and unsurprisingly some people using variables thinking they are object properties, which I strongly advocate against with multiple researched reasons anyway. None of these problems are inherent with constructors and prototypes as shown in the answer. ""Subclassing a built-in"" is not an everyday activity or a common thing to do at all, so I feel surprised you make that as first example when there were supposed to be many pitfalls."

To answer your comment question, `_super.constructor.apply( this, arguments )` is more general than `Shape.call(this, id)`: it has no hardcoded constructor name and works for any number of arguments. Note that my method assumes Node.JS and unique file for each ""class"", the way it works on jsfiddle and with everything thrown together is different because the variables I make would be shared instead of being unique to each file."

Esailija,995876,26668981,0,"@TheFrost I tried to explain - bubbling starts from bottom. When you are in a body event handler, the event has already fired on all elements that are below body. You cannot go back in time and uncall those functions... It does not matter what filter you use. `$body.on('click', 'ul li'` is therefore not a solution because it just changes the filter."
Esailija,995876,26670716,0,"@TheFrost Let us simplify as much as possible. `$(""body"").find(""ul"")` is just the same as `$(""ul"")`. `$(""body"").on(""click"", ""a"", function(){})` is *not* the same as `$(""body"").find(""a"")...` it is the same as `$(""body"").on(""click"", fn)` but with special filtering done in `fn` when the event happens.

Esailija,995876,26611846,0,The methods that work on any object are documented in the specification as generic methods.

Whether something is in the language or the language standard API is completely irrelevant to this."
Esailija,995876,26613601,0,"So let me rephrase this all: The Python way is already sufficient to prevent any accidental access of internals as communicated by the author with underscores and what not. There is really no plausible scenario where someone

Esailija,995876,27008687,0,@CrazyTrain arguing how development is like without using obvious tools like jshint is just wrong. Is there a tool that will tell when leaving out semicolon causes the statement on next line be treated as part of current statement?
Esailija,995876,27009924,0,"@CrazyTrain by saying that one can forget semicolons you imply the absence of any tools. Because it cannot happen when using a tool. Whereas when coding without semicolons one needs human judgement to determine if the code is buggy as you say you ""won't be caught off guard"" because you have developed a habit. When you compare these, both are just as worse off when not using any tools, but semicolons are far better off when using tools. Although this is only because I imagine there is not a tool that could detect when a statement on a new line wasn't intended to follow the previous one."

Esailija,995876,27025560,0,"@DmitryKaigorodov As I understand it, major GCs are performed when memory has become tight and needed. However, it's not memory leak because that memory will be available when you need it. I must emphasize that all JS DOM objects were like this until ~2013 in Chrome! So it's not a big deal and still not a leak."
